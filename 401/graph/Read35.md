# Trees

Create a Graph class which has a head property and 3 methods: addNode , addEdge, getNodes , getNeighbors , size.

## Challenge
Create a addNode class which has a data property.
Create a addEdge class that has properties for Two String Value1 , Value2 .
Create a getNodes method which set Key.
Create a getNighbors method that Take String Data which Return List .
Create a size method that return Size .

## Approach & Efficiency
For each method I took the approach that was most efficient:
- Add - Big O space of n (linear) and time of O(1) (constant).


## API
* .AddNode - data property return void .
* .AddEdge class that has properties for Two String Value1 , Value2 ,return Void.
