# Stack & Queue 
Create a Stack class which has a head property and 4 methods: Push , Pop , Peek , isEmpty.
Create a Queue class which has a head property and 4 methods: enqueue , dequeue , Peek , isEmpty.
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge
Create a LinkedList class which has a head property.
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Create a Push method which Push a value to stack list By LIFO .
Create a Pop method that remove the top value in the stack list .
Create a Peek method that give you the value of the top in the stack list .
Create a isEmpty method that return you a data of top stack list .

## Approach & Efficiency
For each method I took the approach that was most efficient:
- Push - Big O space of n (linear) and time of O(1) (constant).
- Pop - Big O space and time of n (linear).
- Peek - Big O space and time of n (linear).
- isEmpty - Big O space and time of 1 (constant).

## API
* .push(value) - Push a value to stack list By LIFO .
* .Pop(value) - remove the top value in the stack list.
* .Peek() - give you the value of the top in the stack list .
* .Peek() - return you a data of top stack list.
