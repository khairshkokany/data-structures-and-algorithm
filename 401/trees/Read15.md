# Trees

Create a BinarySearchTrees class which has a head property and 3 methods: Add , Contains, isEmpty.
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge
Create a BinarySearchTrees class which has a root property.
Create a BinaryTreesNode class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Create a Add method which adding a value to BinarySearchTree.
Create a Contains method that Check if the data is contain or not ,  return a True Or False Value.
Create a isEmpty method that return you a data of root is null .

## Approach & Efficiency
For each method I took the approach that was most efficient:
- Add - Big O space of 1 (constant) and time of O(n) (linear).
- Contains Big O space of 1 (constant) and time of O(log n) (linear).

## API
* .Add - adding a value to BinarySearchTree. 
* .Contains Check if the data is contained or not ,return a True Or False Value.
