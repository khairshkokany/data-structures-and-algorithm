# Singly Linked List
Create a LinkedList class which has a head property and 3 methods: insert, includes and print.
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge
Create a LinkedList class which has a head property.
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Create an insert method which adds a value to the head of the LinkedList.
Create an includes method that tells you if a value is stored in the LinkedList.
Create a print method that prints all the values in the LinkedList to console.

## Approach & Efficiency
For each method I took the approach that was most efficient:
- insert(value) - Big O space of n (linear) and time of O(1) (constant).
- includes(value) - Big O space and time of n (linear).
- print() - Big O space and time of n (linear).

## API
* .insert(value) - adds a new node with the value to the head of the list.
* .includes(value) - returns a boolean depending on whether the value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* .print() - prints all of the Node values in the Linked List.
